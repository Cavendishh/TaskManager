              <li><strong>Tools and technologies used in</strong>:
              This is a small Task Manager project to make a dynamic JavaScript web application while using good programming practices 
              and without any kind of frameworks or libraries. So it is just pure JavaScript. The Task Manager also has only some basic bootstrap styling (some of it added dynamically) 
              but the focus of the project is not styling.
